# Dashboard Update - Total Rabbits Card Fix

## Overview
Updated the dashboard to display actual rabbit count from the database instead of hardcoded values.

## Changes Made

### 1. Created Dashboard Service (`src/services/dashboard.js`)
- New service to fetch dashboard statistics from the database
- Integrates with existing `agentOrchestrator` for AI-powered insights
- Provides fallback methods for direct database queries
- Includes methods for:
  - `getDashboardStats()` - Main dashboard statistics
  - `getBreedingPairsCount()` - Active breeding pairs
  - `getExpectedBirthsCount()` - Expected births in next 30 days
  - `getRecentActivities()` - Recent breeding and transaction activities
  - `getUpcomingTasks()` - Upcoming breeding and feeding tasks

### 2. Updated Dashboard Component (`src/views/dashboard/AppDashboard.vue`)
- Replaced hardcoded values with dynamic data from the database
- Added loading states for better user experience
- Implemented refresh functionality
- Added proper error handling
- Updated all stat cards to show real data:
  - **Total Rabbits**: Actual count from database
  - **Breeding Pairs**: Active breeding pairs count
  - **Expected Births**: Expected births in next 30 days
  - **Monthly Revenue**: Calculated from expenses (placeholder logic)

### 3. Enhanced User Experience
- Loading indicators while data is being fetched
- Refresh button with loading state
- Proper error handling with fallback values
- Dynamic activity feed showing recent breeding and transaction activities
- Upcoming tasks list with due date formatting

### 4. Database Migrations
- Created `create_rabbits_table.sql` - Ensures rabbits table exists with proper structure
- Created `create_breeding_plans_table.sql` - Ensures breeding_plans table exists with proper structure
- Both tables include proper RLS policies and indexes

## Features

### Real-time Data
- Total rabbit count is fetched from the `rabbits` table
- Breeding pairs count from active `breeding_plans`
- Expected births from upcoming kindling dates
- Recent activities from breeding plans and transactions
- Upcoming tasks from scheduled breeding and feeding

### Error Handling
- Graceful fallback if AI orchestrator fails
- Direct database queries as backup
- Loading states to prevent UI freezing
- Proper error logging for debugging

### Performance
- Efficient database queries with proper indexing
- Parallel data fetching where possible
- Caching through service singleton pattern

## Database Tables Used

### rabbits
- `id`, `rabbit_id`, `name`, `breed`, `gender`, `status`
- Used for total count and active rabbit statistics

### breeding_plans
- `id`, `buck_id`, `doe_id`, `status`, `planned_date`, `expected_kindle_date`
- Used for breeding pairs and expected births

### transactions
- `id`, `type`, `amount`, `description`, `date`
- Used for financial statistics and recent activities

### feeding_schedules
- `id`, `next_feeding_date`, `description`
- Used for upcoming tasks

## Usage

The dashboard now automatically loads real data when the component mounts. Users can:

1. **View Real Statistics**: All numbers are now pulled from the database
2. **Refresh Data**: Click the refresh button to update all statistics
3. **See Recent Activities**: View recent breeding and transaction activities
4. **Track Upcoming Tasks**: See upcoming breeding and feeding schedules

## Technical Implementation

### Service Pattern
- Singleton dashboard service for consistent data access
- Integration with existing AI orchestrator for enhanced insights
- Fallback mechanisms for reliability

### Vue 3 Composition API
- Uses `ref()` for reactive data
- Proper lifecycle management with `onMounted()`
- Computed properties for derived data

### Database Integration
- Supabase client for direct database access
- RLS policies ensure data security
- Efficient queries with proper indexing

## Future Enhancements

1. **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket integration for live data updates
2. **Advanced Analytics**: More detailed charts and trends
3. **Customizable Dashboard**: User-configurable widget layout
4. **Export Functionality**: PDF/Excel export of dashboard data
5. **Mobile Optimization**: Responsive design improvements

## Testing

To test the implementation:

1. Ensure database tables exist (run migrations if needed)
2. Add some test data to the rabbits and breeding_plans tables
3. Navigate to the dashboard
4. Verify that the Total Rabbits card shows the actual count
5. Test the refresh functionality
6. Check that loading states work properly

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Zero Counts**: Check if tables exist and contain data
2. **Loading Forever**: Check browser console for errors
3. **Permission Errors**: Verify RLS policies are correctly set
4. **API Errors**: Check environment variables for Supabase configuration

### Debug Steps

1. Check browser console for error messages
2. Verify database connection in Supabase dashboard
3. Test individual service methods
4. Check RLS policies for current user
