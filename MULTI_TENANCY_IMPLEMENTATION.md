# Multi-Tenancy Implementation Guide

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive multi-tenancy implementation that ensures proper data isolation between users in the Rabbit Management System.

## Problem Statement

**Issue**: Users could view and access data from other users, including:
- Rabbits from other users appearing in their dashboard
- Breeding plans from other users showing up in lists
- Health records, weight records, and transactions not properly filtered by user
- Dashboard statistics including data from all users instead of just the current user

**Root Cause**: Database queries were not filtering by the current user's ID, and Row Level Security (RLS) policies were either missing or not properly configured.

## Solution Implementation

### 1. Database Layer - Row Level Security (RLS)

#### Tables with RLS Policies
All major tables now have proper RLS policies that filter data by user:

- **`rabbits`** - Filtered by `created_by = auth.uid()`
- **`breeding_plans`** - Filtered by `created_by = auth.uid()`
- **`transactions`** - Filtered by `user_id = auth.uid()`
- **`health_records`** - Filtered by `user_id = auth.uid()`
- **`weight_records`** - Filtered by `user_id = auth.uid()`
- **`schedule_events`** - Filtered by `user_id = auth.uid()`
- **`kit_records`** - Filtered by `created_by = auth.uid()`
- **`kit_health_records`** - Filtered by `created_by = auth.uid()`

#### RLS Policy Structure
Each table has four policies:
1. **SELECT** - Users can only view their own records
2. **INSERT** - Users can only insert records with their user ID
3. **UPDATE** - Users can only update their own records
4. **DELETE** - Users can only delete their own records

#### Soft Delete Implementation
All delete operations now use soft delete (setting `is_deleted = true`) instead of hard delete, ensuring data integrity and audit trails.

### 2. Application Layer - User-Aware Queries

#### UserAwareService
Created a new utility service (`src/services/userAwareService.js`) that provides:
- Centralized user authentication
- User-aware query builders for all major tables
- Consistent filtering patterns across the application
- Generic CRUD operations with automatic user filtering

#### Updated Components
All major components now include user authentication and filtering:

**Dashboard Service (`src/services/dashboard.js`)**
- Uses new database function `get_user_dashboard_stats()` for secure, efficient stats
- All queries now filter by current user ID
- Proper error handling for unauthenticated users

**Rabbit Management**
- `RabbitList.vue` - Filters rabbits by `created_by = user.id`
- `RabbitForm.vue` - Ensures new rabbits are created with correct user ID
- Soft delete implementation for rabbit removal

**Breeding Management**
- `BreedingList.vue` - Filters breeding plans by `created_by = user.id`
- `BreedingForm.vue` - Ensures new plans are created with correct user ID
- Rabbit selection filtered to only show user's rabbits

**Health & Weight Records**
- All record forms filter rabbit selection by user
- Record lists only show user's records
- Proper user ID assignment for new records

**Schedule Events**
- All events filtered by user ID
- Rabbit selection limited to user's rabbits

### 3. Database Views with User Filtering

Updated all database views to include proper user filtering:

- **`health_records_with_rabbit`** - Only shows records for current user
- **`weight_records_with_rabbit`** - Only shows records for current user
- **`schedule_events_with_rabbit`** - Only shows events for current user

### 4. Performance Optimization

#### Database Function
Created `get_user_dashboard_stats()` function that:
- Executes all dashboard queries in a single database call
- Uses proper indexing for performance
- Includes all necessary user filtering
- Returns JSON with all dashboard statistics

#### Indexing
All user ID columns are properly indexed for optimal query performance.

## Migration Files

### `supabase/migrations/fix_multi_tenancy_rls.sql`
This migration includes:
1. **RLS Policy Updates** - Recreates all RLS policies with proper user filtering
2. **View Updates** - Updates all views to include user filtering
3. **Database Function** - Creates optimized dashboard stats function
4. **Comments** - Adds helpful documentation to all tables

## Testing Multi-Tenancy

### Test Scenarios
1. **User Registration** - New users should only see their own data
2. **Data Isolation** - Users should not see data from other users
3. **Dashboard Accuracy** - Dashboard should only show current user's statistics
4. **CRUD Operations** - All create, read, update, delete operations should respect user boundaries

### Verification Steps
1. Create two different user accounts
2. Add data (rabbits, breeding plans, etc.) with each user
3. Verify that each user only sees their own data
4. Check dashboard statistics are accurate for each user
5. Verify that cross-user data access is impossible

## Security Benefits

### Data Isolation
- Complete separation of user data
- No possibility of data leakage between users
- Proper access controls at database level

### Audit Trail
- All operations are logged with user ID
- Soft delete maintains data history
- User actions are traceable

### Performance
- Optimized queries with proper indexing
- Reduced data transfer (only user's data)
- Efficient dashboard statistics calculation

## Best Practices Implemented

### 1. Defense in Depth
- Database-level RLS policies
- Application-level user filtering
- Consistent authentication checks

### 2. Principle of Least Privilege
- Users can only access their own data
- No cross-user data access possible
- Proper permission boundaries

### 3. Data Integrity
- Soft delete instead of hard delete
- Consistent user ID assignment
- Proper foreign key relationships

### 4. Performance
- Optimized database queries
- Proper indexing strategy
- Efficient dashboard statistics

## Future Enhancements

### 1. Organization-Level Multi-Tenancy
- Support for multiple users within organizations
- Organization-level data sharing
- Role-based access control

### 2. Advanced Security
- API rate limiting
- Audit logging
- Data encryption at rest

### 3. Performance Monitoring
- Query performance tracking
- User activity monitoring
- Database optimization recommendations

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue**: Users still seeing other users' data
**Solution**: Ensure the migration has been applied and RLS policies are active

**Issue**: Dashboard showing incorrect statistics
**Solution**: Verify the `get_user_dashboard_stats()` function is working correctly

**Issue**: Authentication errors
**Solution**: Check that user authentication is working properly in the application

### Debugging Steps
1. Check RLS policies are enabled: `SELECT schemaname, tablename, rowsecurity FROM pg_tables WHERE schemaname = 'public';`
2. Verify user authentication: Check browser console for auth errors
3. Test database queries: Use Supabase dashboard to verify user filtering
4. Check application logs: Look for authentication or query errors

## Conclusion

The multi-tenancy implementation provides:
- **Complete data isolation** between users
- **Enhanced security** through proper access controls
- **Improved performance** with optimized queries
- **Better user experience** with accurate, user-specific data
- **Scalable architecture** for future enhancements

This implementation ensures that each user's data is completely isolated and secure, providing a robust foundation for the Rabbit Management System.
